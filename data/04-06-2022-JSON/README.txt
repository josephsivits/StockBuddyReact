I compiled these .json files using API calls from https://barchart.com/
HOWEVER, once the file is on my machine, I cannot seem to upload it to the Firestore database.
I've tried for many, many hours but I need another look at it with some fresh eyes.
I can upload JSON data to a Realtime Database using Firebase, but that's not necessiarily what I need.
For the time-being, it's hardcoded in these data files. Bad implementation, on my to-do backlog.
