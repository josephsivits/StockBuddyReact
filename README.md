‚ö†Ô∏èThis app is currently a work in progress!‚ö†Ô∏è
üßë‚ÄçüíªDeveloped for Joseph Sivits capstone course at Concordia Unviersity Chicago.

#### Core Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- React-Native
- JavaScript/JSX
- Firebase
- Python

#### How to run
1. Before installing react-native, you should make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. [Click this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Click this link") and download the correct version for your operating system.
2. Next, download yarn by running the command
		npm install --global yarn
	[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/ "yarn") is a package-maner bundled with a dependency-manager. It automatically checks the dependency-capatability of packages on install, therefore we will use it for this tutorial.
3. Download expo,
		yarn global add expo-cli
	[expo](https://docs.expo.dev/ "expo") is a framework and platform that allows for quick iteration, think of it as the cross-platform runtime environment for react-native code.
	
	You'll also want to download [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go "Expo Go") on your mobile device, if you don't have one present, [install an emulator to your machine.](https://xpertstec.com/how-to-install-android-studio-emulator-on-windows-pc/ "install an emulator to your machine.")
4. Navigate to the downloaded file on the command line and run:
		expo start
	This starts a development server.
	You can either scan the QR code with Expo Go, run with the tethered connection (USB) to the operating system in the menu, or connect with the emulator install.

‚ö†Ô∏èThis app was developed with Android in mind, and does not fully support iOS or Web configurations ‚ö†Ô∏è
